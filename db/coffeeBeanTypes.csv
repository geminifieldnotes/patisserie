Beans,Description
Arabica (Coffea arabica),"Higher quality Arabica beans have a bright body, possess a satisfying amount of acidity, and tend to have a multi-layered intricacy of flavors and aromas; Arabica coffees can be best sampled on the front palate (where sweetness and salinity are most apparent). For best results when brewing this coffee at home, look for Arabica coffee that has a full body and lower acidity."
Robusta (Coffea caniphora),"When drinking, Robusta coffee is best sampled on the back palate (where bitter notes are most apparent), which gives it a heavier body. Higher quality Robusta beans have a smooth texture, low acidity, and often have hints of chocolate associated with their flavor profile. For the best tasting experience when brewing at home, buy Robusta coffee that has information on the way it was grown—this is often information provided on bags of single-origin coffee— as many times, farmers try to take advantage of Robusta’s popularity and grow the bean in unfavorable climates, producing a sub-standard product; if your Robusta has a flat smell or rubbery taste, your coffee has been a victim of these practices."
Liberica (Coffea liberica),"Liberica beans are larger than the others, often asymmetrical, and they’re the only coffee bean in the world that has such an irregular shape. The beans are said to have a unique aroma, consisting of floral and fruity notes, with a full body that possesses a smoky taste; those who have had Liberica coffee say that it is unlike any coffee they have ever tasted—with many saying it does not even taste like coffee, stating that it tastes too “woody”."
Excelsa (Coffea excelsa or Coffea liberica var. dewevrei),"Excelsa grows mostly in Southeast Asia and accounts for a mere 7% of the world’s coffee circulation. It is largely used in blends in order to give the coffee an extra boost of flavor and complexity, better affecting the middle and back palate. Excelsa is said to possess a tart and fruity body—which are flavors reminiscent of a light roast—that also somehow has dark, roasty notes. This mystery lures coffee drinkers from around the world to try and seek out the varietal."
